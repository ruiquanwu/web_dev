*dynamically* generate HTML code that will produce a checkers board that can be interacted with.

1) The program should write the HTML code to the screen, OR to a file.
2) The HTML code for the checkers board should *NOT* be generated by having a bunch of copy/paste rows of print statements, (i.e. do not create duplicate/similar statements for each line), but should be generated dynamically with the least amount of code.
3) The squares on the checkerboard should differ by alternating colors, just like a regular checkers board.
4) On the bottom on the checkers board, there should be two places, where you could enter the names of the 2 players, and a button saying [Start!]
5) When [Start!] is clicked, it should display the names of the players (entered in the spots from #4) in different colors on top of the checkers board
6) When clicking on the empty checker squares on the board, a checker should appear (or something that would look like a round checker, the color is not important, and it does not need to be tied to a player), and remain on the board.
7) If you click on a square where a checker has been previously placed (see #6), that checker should disappear and be replaced with an empty board spot, as it was in the beginning.
8) The code should adhere to standard programming practices, be clean, and indented. Bonus points for creativity.
9) The code should be commented.
